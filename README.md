# Spotifo
Simple [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io) client to set your "Playing" status on discord to your current spotify song.

### Requirements:
- A Recent version of NodeJS
- Internet Connectivity
- Your account token. (Look up **discord selfbot token** on how to get it)

### Known Issues:
You cannot see your own "Playing" status set via this, Discord does not send this back to your client so your client wont be able to show the new status.

### How to use:
1. Download and extract.
2. Use *run.bat* **OR** run *npm install* and then *node spotifo*
